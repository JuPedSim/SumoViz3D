# SumoViz3D

This is a WebGL-based post-visualization of pedestrian simulation data. The results of a simulation (including geometry and pedestrian space-time-coordinates) are displayed in a fully interactive 3D-space which can be manipulated by the viewer.

## What is it all about?
This is part of my bachelor thesis at TU MÃ¼nchen which was submitted on September 17, 2012. It was created upon [Mustafa K. Isik's](https://github.com/codesurgeon/) master thesis on "HTML5-based Visualization of Pedestrian Simulation Data".

## Used technologies
Server-side (not included):

- CouchDB *for storing and processing simulation data*
- node.js *for data-import and delivery*

Client-side:

- [THREE.js](http://threejs.org) WebGL library
- jQuery
- jQuery UI
- [jQuery miniColors](https://github.com/claviska/jquery-miniColors/)
- [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js)
- several [THREEx](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex)-plugins

Kudos to all these developers!
